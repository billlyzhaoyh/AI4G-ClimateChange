### Stage of the project: still trying to find out a problem

## Motivation for the project
Plant-based diet is one of the most impactful ways that we can reduce carbon emission according to project drawdown's research https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/food/plant-rich-diet and the idea is that we should reduce our meat consumption as much as we can as long as we can. It is not championing for vegan or vegetarianism but everyone should eat less meat as much as they can. 

"Plant-rich diets reduce emissions and also tend to be healthier, leading to lower rates of chronic disease. According to a 2016 study, business-as-usual emissions could be reduced by as much as 70 percent through adopting a vegan diet and 63 percent for a vegetarian diet, which includes cheese, milk, and eggs. $1 trillion in annual health-care costs and lost productivity would be saved." - quote from project drawdown

## User research

User Group study:
------------------
Since 18th of February, Billy has started looking into this area of a way of promoting more plant-based diet in people through whatever form that might be. He is running a user group study from Thursday 20th of February to 27th of February with 5-6 of his friends to find out what are the barriers for a wide range of people who are either not on a plant-based rich diet or on a vegan/vegetarian diet. He is also phoning people up to find out their journeies on adopting a plant based diet.

User Interview:
-----------------
Call with Mike:
(Mike is a young profession who just graduated from University, he is now working in London)
Slow progression going into more plant-based meals: four years ago in university halls, started with meat-free Mondays and will get non-meat stuff when going shopping when he doesn’t has a craving for any meat. The goal is to get up to 3 non-meet meals per week.
He pointed out that the non-red meat side of the choice is for an environmental reason and the more veg side of the food is for diet.
One thing is that he never has cravings for vegetarian food but he sometimes has cravings for meat-related food.
For vegetarian food, he doesn’t look up recipes for something simple like stir-fry but for something more complicated like chilli he will look up.
When he goes shopping, he usually gets meat and veg at the same time and for veg he usually gets a big bag of stir-fry mix because that is more interesting. Before, cooking veg is always for some side dish but now veg is main character so requires more efforts. Meat are pre-chopped so take less time to prepare but the whole veg requires cutting etc. 
As a millennial working in London, he has quite a few friends who are vegetarian but people don’t really talk about it (not that interesting a conversation) - he is always surprised to find someone who turned vegetarian.   
Animal cruelty for caged chicken concern him but once they are free-range, it doesn’t really concern him that much. 

## Asking around

Response from the climateaction.tech community:
'I'm working on these figures at the moment but a lot is diet dependent - cutting out beef has a larger impact than chicken for example. Working from average consumption figures, reducing beef consumption by 1 meal a week reduces your yearly CO2e emissions by about 190kg or 1.46%. '
'I think it's hard to generalize - food production involves a complex distribution chain. In fact it's so complex that even the "eat local" movement is questionable. '
'And in general, ‘eat local’ is far less impactful advice than what you eat. On average, transportation contributes 5% of food’s GHG emissions - and as others have implied, distance is not the only factor when considering the impacts of transportation. I agree that it’s hard to generalize, but there are certain rules of thumb that are hard to argue. Among those I’d include:
1. Production impacts are generally higher than transportation impacts.
2. Animal products are almost always more resource-intensive than plant products.
3. Because of the above two points, if you want to have an impact as an individual on this point, you should reduce consumption of animal products - and ‘eat local’ is largely a red herring.'
'That said, the lower the production impacts of the food you’re eating, the higher the proportion of their emissions comes from transportation - so if you’re already plant-based, you might consider transportation. But just because something is ‘local’, doesn’t necessarily mean its transportation is of a lower impact than something from overseas. Container ships are pretty efficient!'
'I was working with @JamieB to work out a conf emissions calculator, and a part the impact of events comes from food. You can see it below:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yXOhbL_f9mK2ZFi98wPwsvEhiiZdtTtwiWFTgqSn_l4/edit#gid=166242908
But crucially, the paper we use for working out the impact of food is this bad boy below:
https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987
It gives figures for the entire supply chain, and also
and percentiles on the range of emissions (some have loads of variation, like dark chocolate and beef).'
'Yup the catering tab will quantify the emissions of a particular meal based on the ingredients. It's broad brush though and you'll see as you enter ingredients that there's a big range in values but it's a good starter for 10 I think.
The paper that Chris links to is beautifully summarised by Hannah Ritchie from Our World in Data here:
https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food'
'interesting data - my conclusion on this is that  CO2e for food is very complicated at the individual level and should be avoided if possible!'
'The study we are using goes for a top down approach to share CO2e emissions between the whole UK population.  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421513009701 We've combined this with the 'Family Food Survey' data to get an average consumption per person of various high impact foods, accounting for under reporting and supply chain losses.  This gives us a rough number of portions per week that we can then modify to fit actual diet or changes in diet.
Currently building an app to help understand this and measure reduction - this will be available from May hopefully'
'The Poore & Nemecek paper is pretty comprehensive and I generally have more confidence in LCA-based approaches than Input-Output approaches.
It's only intended to be a broad steer rather than a definitive answer (hence in the calculator I gave the 10th and 90th percentiles as well as the median value) and by the nature of the quantification task at hand, the focus had to be on the impact of individual meal choices rather than overall impacts of dietary changes.
The complexities of the food supply chain are breathtaking so I doubt we'll ever be able to pin it down much more closely than this (much though I would love to see it happen).
Pleasingly, while the details may be extremely hard to pin down, the overall message is (unusually for anything sustainability related) clear and simple: cut back as much as possible on meat consumption, especially on beef and lamb, and cutting back on dairy wouldn't go amiss too.
Btw you might also like to check out Scarborough et al 2014: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-014-1169-1
Very interesting to hear more about your app. Will keep an eye out.'
