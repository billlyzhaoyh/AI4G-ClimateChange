Plant-based diet is one of the most impactful ways that we can reduce carbon emission according to project drawdown's research https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/food/plant-rich-diet and the idea is that we should reduce our meat consumption as much as we can as long as we can. It is not championing for vegan or vegetarianism but everyone should eat less meat as much as they can. 

"Plant-rich diets reduce emissions and also tend to be healthier, leading to lower rates of chronic disease. According to a 2016 study, business-as-usual emissions could be reduced by as much as 70 percent through adopting a vegan diet and 63 percent for a vegetarian diet, which includes cheese, milk, and eggs. $1 trillion in annual health-care costs and lost productivity would be saved." - quote from project drawdown

Since 18th of February, Billy has started looking into this area of a way of promoting more plant-based diet in people through whatever form that might be. He is running a user group study from Thursday 20th of February to 27th of February with 5-6 of his friends to find out what are the barriers for a wide range of people who are either not on a plant-based rich diet or on a vegan/vegetarian diet.
