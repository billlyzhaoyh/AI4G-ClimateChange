Climate change related facts Q&A

Climate Q&A inspired by Climate Science https://climate-science.com/, a Cambridge startup that ties together 70 volunteers across 11 timezones to produce amazing content on some of the hotly debated topics about climate change.

Billy has conducted the first set of experiments with his friend where he quizzed them on three different questions that were adapted from Climate Science and of course some surprising facts were chosen from there like how mnay times you have to use a cotton bag to balance the environmental impact of subsituting single-use plastic bags. According to research it is 2000+ so it is very shocking! It definitley picked people's interest and whether they will be insipired to talk about it or want to know more about climate change remain to be tested.

The next stage of the project is to prototype a chatbot on Chatfuel+dialogflow+dashbot for better conducting experiments in an automatic fashion. The current idea for it is for it to act as an information hub that uses quiz as an onboarding procedure. Here are some features that Billy is thinking of implementing (feel free to add to this)

* Climate fact Q&A: this will be part of the onboarding flow and part of the persistent modules but if this turns out not to be attractive according to analytics, can totally skip over this. (Help needed: adapt content from Climate Science or other sources into interesting quizzes and brush up with conversation design)

* This feature is extension of the previous one where we ask users to ask all kinds of questions and we ask our team of scientists to research and get back to them via weekly published post (can be a collaboration with Climate Science if we indeed show the demand)

* Birthday gifts or festivity gifts for other people in terms of carbon offsetting https://teamtrees.org/

* Climate simulated games https://justone.earth/ signposted users to this to see if people are interested in this

* Climate news digestion - selected article (non-paywall) from HEATED (can add a sign-up mailing list)

* Climate action type of thing: friends of the earth (how green is your area), climate voice etc

* Personal Carbon footprint calculator to inform the individual about where can they make the biggest impact

* Carbon signal (courtasy of the electricity map) to show the real time carbon footprint of the electricity people are consuming (build awareness and use electricity when it is cleanest)

* Goal setting within the chatbot and send reminders

* Testing and reporting of the newest climate-related app (review and testing is important once the users trust us - can drive higher adoption (assumption))

* Plant based diet section: research/plot showing our personal impact through diet choices, recipes and guidelines on how to become vegetarian/vegan. An impact visuliser for people who are already on a plant-based diet (a few times a week/vegetarian/vegan) to show the impact they are already having.

* Call to start something their own or join the development team behind the chatbot.
