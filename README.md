## AI4G-ClimateChange
We are glad you are here! This is task group for Climate Change for the AI for Good Community and we are looking to make a positive impact on climate change by helping people reduce their carbon footprint.

## How does this github repo work?
Here the folders are divided into 5 parts:
* Framework - this folder highlights the overall methodology we are following courtesy of UNLEASH Innovation Lab (https://unleash.org/)
* Meetup-Notes - recording of discussions that happen during the meetups and these are discussion recordings which might be quite loose
* Outreach - initiatives/communties/companies we have got in touch with and there are potential external collaboration opportunity there
* Product-ideas-learning - the main folder for all the ideas that are currently pursued by the people within the community, these will include description of the project, what stage the project is at and to some extent what kind of help they need. This will also record their learnings through early product experiments to test out their assumptions. (see http://theleanstartup.com/)
* Research - internal research projects to find out what solutions out there and how are they functioning. There are also external challenges that we can form a team to take part. There are also potential data related research projects we can start within the community.

## How can you help?
Please take the intiative to help out some aspects of the project if you see fit or bring your idea here too.
* Start a conversation on Slack and then we can get a pull request going
* Create an issue and we can follow up over there
* Create a Pull Request straight away

## Please use the data responsibily
I have made this repo private for now because some of the product learnings will have some personal identifiable information in them.
